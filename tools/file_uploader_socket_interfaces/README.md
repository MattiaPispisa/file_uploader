# File Uploader Socket Interfaces

Common interfaces for plugins that handle file upload via socket.

Here, there are only interfaces to be used in some [plugins](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/file_uploader/tree/main/plugins) of [en_file_uploader](https://pub.dev/packages/en_file_uploader).

There is no reason to download this library directly.
